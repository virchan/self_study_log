    "The \"SQL 50\" (URL: <a href = \"https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/\">https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/</a>) on Leetcode consists of fifty SQL questions, covering a wide range of topics from \"joins\" to \"textual data transformation.\" Leetcode organised them for job seekers to prepare for interviews and for coding enthusiasts to share their findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through solving this series of SQL challenges, I aimed to:\n",
    "1. demonstrate my advanced coding skills in solving real-world problems, and \n",
    "2. showcase my presentation abilities by creating this document. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I highlighted the performance optimisation achieved through the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which resulted in an 80% improvement in query runtime. This document not only reflects my technical expertise, but also my capability to deliver quantifiable improvements and innovate efficient solutions, making me a valuable asset in a full-time data scientist/analyst role.\n",

    "I like to use common table expressions (CTE, the `WITH` clause,) in my SQL queries:\n",

    "\n",
    "From a presenter's perspective, CTE enables users to break down SQL queries into smaller individual logic components. Along with a good variable naming scheme, this improves the code's readability, and arguably makes error analysis and troubleshooting more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a software engineering standpoint, SQL queries that utilise CTEs generally run faster. This is due to the divide-and-conquer nature of CTEs, similar to dynamic programming. To illustrate this, let's look at the \"Triangle Judgement\" problem on Leetcode (URL: [https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement/description/)):\n",

    "Both versions perform the same operations: they first compute the sum of two sides and then compare it with the third one. The difference lies in how each version executes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first query, the sum of sides `x+y`, `x+z`, and `y+z` are computed three times:\n",

    "\n",
    "and stored as new columns. These pre-computed values (`xy`, `xz`, and `yz`) are then reused in the main `SELECT` query. This aviods redundant calculation, and reduces the computational overhead. This is the divide-and-conquer strategy in action, breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in performance is well-established in the runtime. The first query has an average runtime of 1364 ms, whereas the second has 274 ms - an improvement of over 80%. Therefore, the second query is more efficient by utilising CTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this example emphasises the advantage of CTE by improving readability and speeding up computation."
